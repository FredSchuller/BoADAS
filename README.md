# Important notes

 The BoADAS package runs in python2.x with some routines written in Fortran90.
 Therefore, you need to have python2.x and a fortran compiler installed.

 In addition, it uses a number of external packages. A tarball containing all the packages required (inclusing python2.3 - which is not required if you have a more recent python2.x interpreter) can be downloaded from here:

It also contains a README files with detailed installation notes.
